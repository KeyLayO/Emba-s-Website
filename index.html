        About myself:<br />
        I am Kurt Jerald M. Emba and I am 20 years old. I am currently a second-year student studying Computer Science
        at St. Louis College Valenzuela. The reason why I'm studying Computer Science is because I want to gain
        knowledge about how the computer works. Also, I want to become a Penetration Tester someday. I also heard that
        having a CS Degree can make you a billionaire HAHA. As for my hobbies, I like playing chess. I'm not good at it
        but it's fun (if you are winning). I also spend time listening to music to calm myself. Playing video games is
        also my hobby. I also like cats.
